                three-wheeled) trike, is a two- or three-wheeled motor vehicle.[1][2][3] Motorcycle design varies
                greatly to suit a range of different purposes: long-distance travel, commuting, cruising, sport
                (including racing), and off-road riding. Motorcycling is riding a motorcycle and being involved in other
                related social activity such as joining a motorcycle club and attending motorcycle rallies.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The term motorcycle has different legal definitions depending on
                jurisdiction (see ยง Legal definitions and restrictions).

                There are three major types of motorcycle: street, off-road, and dual purpose. Within these types, there
                are many sub-types of motorcycles for different purposes. There is often a racing counterpart to each
                type, such as road racing and street bikes, or motocross including dirt bikes.

                Street bikes include cruisers, sportbikes, scooters and mopeds, and many other types. Off-road
                motorcycles include many types designed for dirt-oriented racing classes such as motocross and are not
                street legal in most areas. Dual purpose machines like the dual-sport style are made to go off-road but
                include features to make them legal and comfortable on the street as well.

                Each configuration offers either specialised advantage or broad capability, and each design creates a
                different riding posture.

                In some countries the use of pillions (rear seats) is restricted.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Many authorities have excluded steam powered, electric motorcycles or
                diesel-powered two-wheelers from the definition of a 'motorcycle', and credit the Daimler Reitwagen as
                the world's first motorcycle.[17][18][19] Given the rapid rise in use of electric motorcycles
                worldwide,[20] defining only internal-combustion powered two-wheelers as 'motorcycles' is increasingly
                problematic. The first (petroleum fueled) internal-combustion motorcycles, like the German Reitwagen,
                were, however, also the first practical motorcycles.</p>
